# cursiva-js

`cursiva-js` is an experiment about drawing script typing on a `<canvas>` HTML element.

The code is made in pure JavaScript (ECMAScript 6), with no use of third-party frameworks or
libraries.

Some prototyping functions were added for creating animated drawing in a canvas, following the
formulas for curves as described in [this article](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curva_de_B%C3%A9zier).

## Supported browsers

Any modern browser should be able to run the application with no issues, since it's made with
standard code.

Some polyfills were made to fix issues in Internet Explorer 11.

## Development

Code is available at https://github.com/israel-munoz/cursiva. It requires Node.JS 8.x or higher to run.

Visual Studio Code was used for development.

The application runs on a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) project,
configured with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert to ECMAScript 5.
